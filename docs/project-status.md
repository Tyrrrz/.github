# Project Status

Each of my open source projects is attributed with a **status label**.
This label indicates the level of commitment I have towards the project and can be either one of the following:

- ðŸŸ¢ **Active**

  - Project is in active development
  - Issues of all types are accepted
  - Pull requests of all types are accepted

- ðŸŸ¡ **Maintenance mode**

  - Project is no longer in active development
  - Only bug-related issues are accepted
  - Only bug-related pull requests are accepted
  - New features are unlikely to be added
  - Project status may eventually transition to "discontinued" or back to "active"

- ðŸ”´ **Discontinued**

  - Project is no longer in development
  - Issues are not accepted
  - Pull requests are not accepted
  - Repository is archived

Regardless of the project status, existing releases will always remain available on GitHub or in the corresponding package repository (NuGet, NPM, etc.).
