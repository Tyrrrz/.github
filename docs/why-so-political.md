# Why So Political

Since early March 2022, most of my projects now include a "terms of use" section that effectively serves as a form of "moral license" for people who want to use them.
This section was inspired by a similar [set of terms implemented by Bank of Georgia](https://reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/t6koid/when_people_from_russia_try_to_open_up_a_bank) in response to the [Russian invasion of Ukraine](https://war.ukraine.ua).

I am Ukrainian myself, so the war waged by Russia has a very direct influence on my life and wellbeing.
The terms of use reflect that situation â€” **I don't want the products of my free labor be used by those who undermine my own existence or the sovereignty of the country that I live in**.

Below are some commonly asked questions in regard to the terms of use, and their answers.

- **Q**: Why do you try to make your software political?

  - **A**: Open source is a way of self-expression for me and currently my whole life is "political".
    I am free to do whatever I want with my projects, and if you don't find that acceptable you are also free to not use them.

- **Q**: Do you realize that these terms don't align with the [open source definition](https://opensource.org/osd)?

  - **A**: Yes. I don't care. My own livelihood is more important than arbitrary open source ideals.

- **Q**: Do you realize that these terms are most likely not enforceable?

  - **A**: Yes. I expect them to have about the same level of legal force as code of conduct.

- **Q**: But what about X country or Y issue? Why didn't you add that to your terms of use too?

  - **A**: I live in a country that's being invaded.
    Maybe at some point I will be similarly passionate about some other issue, but for now this obviously takes priority.
    You are welcome to create terms of use for your own projects and fill them as you please, though.

- **Q**: You make everything sound so black and white, have you considered other perspectives?

  - **A**: There are no other perspectives, resisting a genocidal war is as black and white as it gets.
    If you disagree, we have nothing to talk about.

- **Q**: If I make a derivative work based on your project (e.g. use your library), would I need to also include your terms of use in my own project?

  - **A**: No, you don't have to do that.
    But I won't stop you if you want to.
