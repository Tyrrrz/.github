# Project Status

All of my open source projects are attributed with a "status" label.
This label specifies the level of commitment I have to the project, which can be either one of the following:

- ✅ **Active**. Project is in active development. Both bug reports and feature suggestions are welcome, as well as pull requests.
- ⚠️ **Suspended**. Project is _temporarily_ unmaintained and will likely receive no attention in the meantime. The readme should also mention the reason why it's in this state and clarify the conditions it needs to meet to resume (usually an external blocker needs to be resolved).
- ⚠️ **Maintenance mode**. Project is no longer in active development. Only bug reports and bug fix pull requests are accepted. New features are very unlikely to be added.
- ⛔ **Discontinued**. Project is no longer in development. New issues and pull requests are no longer accepted. The repository is archived.

Regardless of the project status, existing releases will always remain available on GitHub or in the corresponding package repository (NuGet, NPM, etc).
